CMake Deprecation Warning at C:/FlutterProject/go_shop/build/windows/x64/extracted/firebase_cpp_sdk_windows/CMakeLists.txt:17 (cmake_minimum_required):
  Compatibility with CMake < 3.10 will be removed from a future version of
  CMake.

  Update the VERSION argument <min> value.  Or, use the <min>...<max> syntax
  to tell CMake that the project requires at least <min> but has been updated
  to work with policies introduced by <max> or earlier.
